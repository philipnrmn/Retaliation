## Retaliation - a fork

This is a fork of the excellent Retaliation Jenkins plugin. It uses HIDAPI in preference 
to libusb, since a bug in libusb for OSX prevents it working (as of November 2014, on 
OSX Yosemite). 

See the original documentation for details (RETALIATION.md in the project root):
